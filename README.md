# Research Repository Context Map

This repository contains multiple independent research projects. The table below gives a quick map of each project folder and its subfolders.

| Subject | Summary |
|---|---|
| [Casimir Propulsion Concepts](./cashmir/README.md) | Casimir-propulsion concept modeling focused on nanoscale pulsed arrays vs. macroscale static gaps, plus simulation scripts and generated plots. |
| [EM-GW Priming Window](./em-gw-priming-window/README.md) | Ionosphere-troposphere coupling project proposing a conductivity-memory priming window where prior solar EM forcing multiplicatively gates later gravity-wave responses. |
| [Gaussian Surface Geometry](./gaussian-hill-surface/README.md) | Differential-geometry exploration of Gaussian surfaces, including the 1-sigma curvature transition interpretation and visuals. |
| [PD-L1 Kinetics Research](./pd-l1-kinetics/README.md) | Oncology research project on dynamic PD-L1 induction velocity as a decision signal after immune priming in mTNBC. |
