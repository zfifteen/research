# Artifacts Index

This folder stores tracked project artifacts that support the core claims in `../README.md`.

- `figures/concepts/`: conceptual visuals used in the main narrative.
- `figures/benchmarks/`: benchmark charts used for performance comparison.
- `reports/`: exported report deliverables.

Artifact policy:
- Keep canonical published artifacts in this tree.
- Use `artifacts/tmp/` and `artifacts/runs/` for transient outputs (ignored by git).
