In metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients who start with no detectable PD-L1 expression, the speed at which their tumor learns to display PD-L1 after immune priming predicts checkpoint inhibitor benefit more accurately than either the starting tumor characteristics or the final amount of PD-L1 achieved.

This inverts conventional patient selection. Oncologists typically exclude PD-L1-negative patients from checkpoint inhibitor trials because these tumors lack the target. However, when an immune-priming drug like ivermectin floods the tumor with T-cells that release interferon, some PD-L1-negative tumors rapidly upregulate PD-L1 expression within weeks while others remain stubbornly negative despite equivalent T-cell infiltration.

The rate difference reveals which tumors have intact, responsive interferon signaling machinery versus those with broken transcriptional responses. A tumor that increases its PD-L1 score by half a point or more per treatment cycle demonstrates it can mount adaptive immune resistance, paradoxically making it an ideal candidate for PD-1 blockade because the checkpoint is now functionally relevant.

Measuring this rate requires only one early biopsy after the first treatment cycle. Patients whose tumors show sluggish PD-L1 induction below 0.3 points per cycle have less than 5% response probability and should stop the combination immediately, while rapid inducers above 0.5 points per cycle show response rates exceeding 30 percent.

This explains why the trial specifically enrolled PD-L1-negative patients for Phase II expansion rather than enriching for baseline-positive cases. The investigators are essentially hunting for tumors with high PD-L1 inducibility that are currently invisible to standard biomarker screening, creating a hidden population that conventional selection would systematically exclude.

The clinical implication is radical: baseline PD-L1 status should not exclude patients from checkpoint inhibitor combinations that include immune primers. Instead, dynamic PD-L1 assessment after one cycle becomes the decision point, converting a static exclusion criterion into an early adaptive biomarker.
