Triple-negative breast cancer is often described as one of the toughest corners of breast cancer care, and families living inside that reality already know why. It tends to move fast, offers fewer targeted options, and asks patients to keep making difficult choices under pressure. Immunotherapy brought real hope to some, but not to everyone. In practice, many people were sorted early by a single marker and told they were outside the likely benefit zone.

That process felt clean on paper. If the target was not seen at baseline, treatment was unlikely to work. But life in clinic is rarely that simple. Tumors evolve. Immune systems react. The biology at diagnosis is not always the biology after therapy starts.

This is where the current story changes direction. Instead of treating baseline status as a final answer, the newer thinking treats it as context. The key question becomes whether a tumor can shift once treatment begins. Some may stay quiet. Others may wake up quickly. If that difference can be seen early, care can become more precise and less wasteful.

For patients, the promise is not magic. It is fairness: being judged by how the disease responds to treatment, not only by what it looked like on day zero.
