Timing is not a technical footnote in immunotherapy strategy. It is part of the mechanism. After immune-priming treatment begins, there is a biologic sequence: stress signals are released, antigen-presenting cells activate, T cells are primed, and infiltration builds over the following days. If this sequence is real, then early sampling windows should be chosen to match it.

That is why an intermittent schedule can make sense beyond safety alone. Pulses of treatment may trigger danger signaling, while short breaks allow immune processing steps to unfold. A later pulse can then meet a microenvironment that is already changing. The goal is to synchronize therapy with immune kinetics rather than deliver treatment in a biologically blind rhythm.

For patients, this framing helps answer a common question: why not just wait longer before judging? Sometimes waiting is necessary. But if the expected cascade should already be visible and the marker remains flat, prolonged continuation may offer little upside.

Conversely, when early change appears on schedule, it provides a rational reason to stay the course. In both directions, timing-aligned assessment supports decisions that are less arbitrary. It treats treatment as a biological process unfolding in time, not a fixed protocol that ignores when signals should reasonably emerge.
