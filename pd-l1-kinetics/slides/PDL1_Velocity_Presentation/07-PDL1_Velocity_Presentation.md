Two patients can start in the same place and still follow very different paths. Both may have tumors labeled PD-L1 negative at baseline. Both may receive the same treatment sequence. But after early cycles, one tumor may shift quickly while the other barely moves. That difference in pace is the heart of this story.

Traditional decision-making tends to compare snapshots. Was the marker present before treatment? Is it above or below a threshold now? The velocity view asks a more human question: how fast is the biology changing once pressure is applied? A rapid rise suggests the immune signaling machinery is waking up and responding. A flat or slow pattern may suggest deeper resistance that a checkpoint drug alone cannot overcome.

This is not just a statistical nuance. It can change real choices at the bedside. If movement is strong, treatment can continue with clearer rationale. If movement is minimal, patients can be spared months of low-yield therapy and moved earlier to other options.

For families navigating uncertainty, velocity offers a different kind of clarity. It does not pretend to predict everything. It simply respects that response is dynamic. In this model, what matters most is not where the tumor started, but whether it is meaningfully changing when treatment begins.
