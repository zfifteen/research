# Independent Research Accounts on X

## Objective
Identify independent X accounts that regularly publish primary-source analysis relevant to biomedicine, oncology, immunology, and repurposed-drug discussions, with particular relevance to the `pd-l1-kinetics` workstream.

## Selection Criteria
1. Emphasis on source documents, trial data, or methodological critique.
2. Demonstrated independent research profile (individual or small-team output).
3. Consistent activity in biomedical or clinically adjacent topics.
4. Potential relevance to PD-L1 dynamics, immune priming, or translational oncology discourse.

## Priority Accounts
1. `@Jikkyleaks`  
Focus: FOI documents, trial-data interpretation, and pharmaceutical policy analysis.
2. `@EthicalSkeptic`  
Focus: Independent statistical analysis and model-based interpretation of public datasets.
3. `@Kevin_McKernan`  
Focus: Genomics-oriented technical analysis, sequencing issues, and raw data review.
4. `@CanningPharm` (Maria Gutschi)  
Focus: Pharmacy and pharmacovigilance-oriented document review and independent commentary.

## Oncology and Repurposed-Drug Relevant Accounts
1. `@MakisMD` (Dr. William Makis)  
Focus: Oncology case commentary and repurposed-drug narratives.
2. `@PierreKory` (Dr. Pierre Kory)  
Focus: Clinical interpretation of repurposed-drug evidence and published studies.
3. `@YellowHideaway` (Hanna Parikka)  
Focus: Technical mechanism-focused commentary in biotechnology and repurposed therapeutics.

## Additional Accounts for Broader Medical Research Monitoring
1. `@MaryanneDemasi`  
Focus: Investigative reporting and publication-level critique in medicine.
2. `@ClareCraigPath` (Dr. Clare Craig)  
Focus: Pathology and clinical-data interpretation.
3. `@OpenVaet`  
Focus: Collective data analysis with emphasis on public-health datasets.

## Recommended Outreach Sequence
1. Initial post mentions: `@Jikkyleaks @MakisMD @Kevin_McKernan @EthicalSkeptic`
2. Follow-up thread mentions: `@CanningPharm @PierreKory @YellowHideaway`
3. Add concise scientific framing, then provide the repository link and figure reference.
