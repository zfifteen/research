Cancer care often waits for imaging milestones that come weeks or months into therapy. By then, patients may have already absorbed side effects from treatment that was never going to help. The adaptive model in this work aims to shorten that gap by building an earlier feedback loop.

The idea is straightforward. Start treatment, then check biological movement during the first stretch rather than waiting for late confirmation. If the tumor shows meaningful immune-linked change, continue with stronger justification. If the signal stays weak, pivot while there is still time to pursue other options.

This kind of timing shift matters in real life. It can reduce unnecessary toxicity, avoid emotional drag from prolonged uncertainty, and help patients spend more of their limited time on therapies with a better chance of benefit. It may also reduce financial strain tied to expensive, low-yield treatment continuation.

Most importantly, it changes the role of biomarkers from one-time labels to ongoing guides. Treatment becomes a sequence of informed adjustments, not a single irreversible bet.

For patients, that can feel more aligned with how illness is actually lived: decision by decision, response by response, with care plans that evolve as the body reveals what is and is not working.
