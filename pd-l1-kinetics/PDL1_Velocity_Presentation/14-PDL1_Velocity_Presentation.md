Although this story starts in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, its logic reaches further. Many cancers remain immunologically cold at baseline, and many combination strategies are built on the same hope: one treatment can prepare the ground so another treatment can finally work.

That shared structure creates a shared problem. How can clinicians tell early whether the first step truly changed the biology in a meaningful way? Static baseline markers are often too blunt for that job. Dynamic velocity-style readouts may offer a better answer because they capture response in motion.

The specific marker or platform may differ by disease. Some settings may rely on tissue assays, others on blood signatures, imaging patterns, or molecular profiles. The principle is consistent: measure change after priming, then use that change to guide continuation, escalation, or pivot.

For patients across different cancers, this could support a more adaptive and less wasteful treatment journey. Instead of committing to long protocols with limited early feedback, care teams could adjust based on whether the biology is actually turning.

In that sense, the framework is less a niche hypothesis and more a template for combination immunotherapy development: when treatment is designed to create a target, success should be judged by how quickly that target truly emerges.
