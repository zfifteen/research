A useful clinical idea eventually needs boundaries. Not rigid walls, but working zones that help teams decide what to do next. The velocity framework proposes exactly that: a way to sort early trajectories into likely responders, uncertain middle patterns, and likely nonresponders.

The purpose is not to create false precision. It is to prevent two common harms at once. First, stopping too early in someone whose tumor is clearly waking up. Second, continuing too long when biology remains flat and alternatives should be considered. The middle zone is equally important because uncertainty is real, and many patients do not fit clean categories after one checkpoint.

In that gray area, reassessment becomes a feature, not a flaw. Additional timepoints or complementary blood-based signals can help clarify direction before major decisions are locked in.

For patients, this approach can feel more honest than all-or-nothing rules. It acknowledges that biology unfolds over time and that treatment plans should adapt accordingly. It also makes room for shared decision-making by connecting biomarker movement to concrete next steps.

These thresholds are still provisional and must be validated. But even as hypotheses, they provide something crucial: a practical structure for testing dynamic care instead of relying on static assumptions.
