Any promising biomarker idea can fail in practice if the measurement system is weak. This framework is no exception, and its limits need to be faced directly. Proposed velocity cutoffs are starting points, not settled truths. Different assays, tumor contexts, and treatment regimens may require different boundaries before decisions can be trusted.

There is also the problem of noise. PD-L1 scoring already carries variability across readers and samples. When velocity is calculated from differences over time, small errors can grow. Without standardized workflows and careful quality control, false reassurance and false pessimism become real risks.

Access is another barrier. Not every patient has lesions that are easy or safe to biopsy repeatedly. Some will need alternative approaches, such as blood-based signals, if dynamic monitoring is to be equitable in real-world care.

Finally, tumors are patchy. A sample from one region may tell a different story from another region on the same day. Apparent change can reflect where tissue was taken, not true biologic shift.

None of these limitations invalidate the idea. They define the work ahead. For patients, transparency about these challenges is essential. Confidence should come from rigorous validation, not enthusiasm alone, especially when treatment decisions carry such personal stakes.
