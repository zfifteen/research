# PD-L1-Kinetics

Independent research materials on **dynamic PD-L1 kinetics after immune priming** in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC), with emphasis on whether **early PD-L1 induction velocity** can outperform baseline PD-L1 status for checkpoint inhibitor decision-making.

## Core Thesis

Static baseline PD-L1 negativity may exclude patients who could still benefit from checkpoint inhibition after immune priming.  
This project explores a dynamic framework:

- Measure PD-L1 before treatment.
- Reassess early on-treatment (for example after cycle 1).
- Use **rate of change** (`delta PD-L1 per cycle`) to guide continuation vs. treatment pivot.

Working hypothesis from this research stream:

- Faster PD-L1 induction suggests intact interferon-responsive machinery and higher probability of checkpoint relevance.
- Slower or absent induction suggests low likelihood of benefit and supports early strategy change.

## How To Use This Repo

1. Read `docs/INSIGHT.md` for the one-page concept.
2. Read `docs/white-paper.md` for complete scientific argumentation.
3. Use slide/video assets for talks, asynchronous sharing, or collaborator briefing.
4. Reuse the per-slide Markdown in `slides/PDL1_Velocity_Presentation/` for edits, narration changes, or deck regeneration workflows.

## Scope and Status

- This is a research framework and synthesis, not a completed validation study.
- Thresholds and decision cutoffs discussed in the manuscript are **hypothesis-level** and require prospective validation.
- Clinical use should follow institutional protocols, regulatory requirements, and clinician judgment.
