# PD-L1-Kinetics

Independent research materials on **dynamic PD-L1 kinetics after immune priming** in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC), with emphasis on whether **early PD-L1 induction velocity** can outperform baseline PD-L1 status for checkpoint inhibitor decision-making.

## Core Thesis

Static baseline PD-L1 negativity may exclude patients who could still benefit from checkpoint inhibition after immune priming.  
This project explores a dynamic framework:

- Measure PD-L1 before treatment.
- Reassess early on-treatment (for example after cycle 1).
- Use **rate of change** (`delta PD-L1 per cycle`) to guide continuation vs. treatment pivot.

Working hypothesis from this research stream:

- Faster PD-L1 induction suggests intact interferon-responsive machinery and higher probability of checkpoint relevance.
- Slower or absent induction suggests low likelihood of benefit and supports early strategy change.

## Repository Contents

- `white-paper.md`: Full manuscript with rationale, mechanism, trial context, figures, limitations, and references.
- `INSIGHT.md`: Compressed statement of the central clinical/research insight.
- `white-paper-banner.png`: Visual asset for sharing or presentation headers.
- `PD-L1-Velocity-Presentation.pptx` / `PDL1_Velocity_Presentation.pptx`: Slide deck versions.
- `PD-L1-Velocity-Presentation.mp4` / `PDL1_Velocity_Presentation.mp4`: Rendered presentation videos.
- `white-paper-presentation.pptx` / `white-paper-presentation.mp4`: Alternative white-paper presentation outputs.

## How To Use This Repo

1. Read `INSIGHT.md` for the one-page concept.
2. Read `white-paper.md` for complete scientific argumentation.
3. Use slide/video assets for talks, asynchronous sharing, or collaborator briefing.
4. Reuse the per-slide Markdown in `PDL1_Velocity_Presentation/` for edits, narration changes, or deck regeneration workflows.

## Scope and Status

- This is a research framework and synthesis, not a completed validation study.
- Thresholds and decision cutoffs discussed in the manuscript are **hypothesis-level** and require prospective validation.
- Clinical use should follow institutional protocols, regulatory requirements, and clinician judgment.
