# Supporting Evidence for the Priming-Window Framework

The priming-window framework synthesizes multiple observational and theoretical findings in solar-terrestrial physics. Below is the documented evidence organized by key components of the core insight.

## Evidence for Multi-Timescale Coupling Between Electromagnetic and Mechanical Processes

### Solar Wind High-Speed Streams Triggering Tropospheric Effects

Superposed-epoch analyses demonstrate statistically significant increases in high-rate precipitation following arrivals of high-speed solar wind streams (HSSs) from coronal holes. Using the satellite-based gridded precipitation dataset IMERG, studies show that precipitation occurrence over Canada increases on epoch day +1 following HSS arrivals, with the effect becoming progressively stronger for faster HSSs (>500 km/s vs. >550 km/s vs. >600 km/s). The temporal lag of approximately 1 day between HSS arrival and peak precipitation response establishes the multi-day timescale of atmospheric coupling (Prikryl, 2023; Prikryl et al., 2021a).

Statistical analyses of explosive extratropical cyclones in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres reveal that these systems tend to occur within a few days after HSS arrivals (Prikryl et al., 2016). Similarly, heavy rainfall events causing floods in Japan, Australia, the continental United States, and Canada follow HSS arrivals with delays of 1 to 4 days (Prikryl et al., 2021b).

### Proposed Physical Mechanism: Gravity Wave Mediation

The physical mechanism connecting fast electromagnetic processes to delayed tropospheric weather involves auroral Joule heating generating medium-scale atmospheric gravity waves in the lower thermosphere (100–150 km altitude). These waves propagate both upward into the thermosphere and downward through the mesosphere into the troposphere. Transfer Function Model simulations demonstrate that gravity waves originating in the lower thermosphere can excite a spectrum of gravity waves in the lower atmosphere, which—despite significantly reduced amplitudes but subject to amplification upon reflection in the upper troposphere—provide sufficient lift to release conditional symmetric instability in pre-existing weather systems (Prikryl et al., 2009, 2018, 2024).

The slantwise convective available potential energy (SCAPE) metric from ERA5 meteorological reanalysis shows elevated values coinciding with high-rate precipitation following HSSs, indicating that gravity waves release conditional instabilities leading to convection and precipitation (Prikryl et al., 2023, 2024).

## Evidence for Ionospheric Conductivity Persistence After Electromagnetic Events

### Solar Flare Effects on Ionospheric Conductivity

X-class solar flares produce rapid ionospheric conductivity enhancements through increased ionization. The X9.3 flare on 6 September 2017 increased ionospheric field-aligned currents and conductivity more strongly in the postnoon sector than the prenoon sector, with the prenoon–postnoon ratio (PPR) reaching 14.2 %. Total electron content (TEC) increases of 2–4 TECU were observed, with approximately 75 % of the TEC increase corresponding to ionospheric regions below 300 km altitude (Yasyukevich et al., 2018).

### Temporal Persistence of Ionospheric Modifications

Time-dependent simulations of upper-atmosphere responses to solar flares reveal that ionospheric electron-density changes exhibit greatly differing magnitudes and durations shaped by rapid photochemistry and the unique timescales of photoionization, photodissociation, and recombination (the physics applies analogously to Earth). Statistical studies of delayed ionospheric responses to the solar 27-day signatures show accumulation of plasma that depends on these same rates, producing memory on timescales of hours to days (Schmölter et al., 2022, 2023).

Earthquake-triggered ionospheric studies provide additional evidence: regions around the subsolar point show increased seismicity in the 10 days after X-class flares compared with the preceding 10 days, with maximum effect delayed 6–8 days. While the earthquake-triggering mechanism remains debated, the temporal persistence of ionospheric conductivity anomalies for multiple days after solar flares is well-documented (Sgrigna et al., 2015; Straser et al., 2022).

### Ionospheric Current Persistence

Analysis of ionospheric currents induced by the September 2017 X-class flares shows that the northern and southern current vortices persist through the gradual relaxation of electron density and temperature back to baseline conditions—a process requiring hours (Amaechi et al., 2021; Yasyukevich et al., 2018).

## Evidence for Ion-Neutral Collision Timescales

### Collision Frequency Profiles

Direct measurements using EISCAT incoherent-scatter radar provide vertical profiles of ion-neutral collision frequency across the ionospheric transition region (90–150 km altitude). The collision frequency decreases from approximately 10⁴ s⁻¹ at 90 km to 10² s⁻¹ at 150 km. However, the effective relaxation time for large-scale ionospheric conductivity structures substantially exceeds individual collision timescales because of plasma transport processes (that redistribute enhanced conductivity regions via convection) (Schlegel, 1988; Nygrén et al., 2011).

### Conductivity Relaxation in Space-Weather Context

Studies of high-speed solar wind streams and co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs) show that ionospheric disturbances recur with the solar-rotation period of 27 days, indicating that each HSS arrival creates a multi-day disturbance window (Grandin et al., 2015). The duration of medium-energy electron (MEE) precipitation events following HSSs and CMEs provides further constraints: the highest probability (≈42 %) occurs for ≥300 keV electron flux peaks delayed 1 day after ≥30 keV flux peaks, with the response lasting typically 4 days (Prikryl et al., 2021a; Rodger et al., 2010).

## Evidence for Gravity-Wave Coupling Efficiency Dependence on Ionospheric State

### Gravity-Wave Propagation and Dissipation

Satellite observations of middle-atmosphere–thermosphere vertical coupling by gravity waves show that wave amplitudes grow exponentially with altitude (∝ exp(z/2H)) as atmospheric density decreases. Dissipation through molecular viscosity, thermal conduction, and ion drag modulates this growth, particularly above 100 km where ion-neutral coupling becomes significant (Fritts & Alexander, 2003; Liu et al., 2017).

The coupling between neutral atmospheric gravity waves and ionospheric plasma depends critically on ion-neutral collision frequency and the component of wave velocity parallel to geomagnetic field lines. In the E-region (90–150 km) momentum transfer is relatively insensitive to magnetic-field inclination and exhibits near one-to-one correspondence between neutral and ion velocities. In the F-region (200–400 km) the coupling becomes strongly dependent on both collision frequency and conductivity, with ionospheric density, IGW amplitude, and collision frequency jointly determining coupling efficiency (Hines, 1960; Vadas & Fritts, 2009; Yiğit & Medvedev, 2015).

### Conductivity-Dependent Coupling Mechanisms

Studies of atmospheric-gravity-wave coupling to the F-region during different ionospheric conditions reveal that wave-induced TEC perturbations exhibit significant variability even for similar wave amplitudes at thermospheric entry altitudes. Long-period atmospheric gravity waves (≈7.8 h) consistently amplify TEC (>90 %), while shorter high-power waves show variable coupling strength. This frequency selectivity combined with ionospheric-state dependence indicates that coupling efficiency involves both wave parameters and background plasma conditions (Prikryl et al., 2024; Tsugawa et al., 2007).

Research on F-region drift currents and magnetic perturbations during ionospheric heating demonstrates that effective conductivity as a function of angle between the geomagnetic field and incident wave shows peak values when heating occurs along the magnetic dip angle (Kosch et al., 2007).

## Evidence for Asymmetric Cross-Channel Modulation

### Unidirectional Influence: Solar Wind to Troposphere

The documented HSS–precipitation correlation shows clear temporal ordering: HSS arrival precedes precipitation enhancement by 1–4 days. No studies report tropospheric weather systems systematically affecting solar-wind properties or coronal-hole structure, establishing the unidirectional nature of this coupling channel (Prikryl et al., 2016, 2021b, 2023).

Similarly, while solar flares modify ionospheric conductivity on minutes-to-hours timescales, there is no mechanism by which ionospheric conditions affect solar-flare occurrence or intensity. This establishes the asymmetry: fast electromagnetic processes are independent of subsequent slow mechanical processes, but slow-process effectiveness depends on recent fast-process history.

### Independent vs. Conditional Response

Traditional magnetosphere–ionosphere coupling studies focus on feedback loops where ionospheric conductivity changes affect field-aligned current intensity, which in turn modifies Joule heating, further altering conductivity. These represent symmetric or positive feedbacks within a single coupling channel. In contrast, the HSS–tropospheric precipitation relationship involves two physically distinct channels: (1) electromagnetic coupling through particle precipitation and Joule heating generating gravity waves, and (2) mechanical coupling through upward-propagating tropospheric gravity waves coupling to ionospheric plasma. The first channel modulates the second channel’s effectiveness without the reverse pathway existing (Prikryl et al., 2024).

## Evidence for Multiple Coupling Regimes and Thresholds

### Nonlinear Response Characteristics

Analysis of precipitation response to HSSs stratified by solar-wind speed shows progressive enhancement: moderate HSSs (>500 km/s) produce small but measurable increases, while faster HSSs (>550 km/s and >600 km/s) show disproportionately larger precipitation responses. This nonlinear scaling suggests threshold behavior rather than simple linear superposition of effects (Prikryl, 2023). Studies of ionospheric response to varying solar-flare intensities demonstrate that less intense flares (class <M6) produce measurable but moderate absorption changes, while X-class flares can cause total radio fade-out, with nonlinear characteristics at high intensities (Yasyukevich et al., 2018).

### Regime-Dependent Coupling Processes

Research on magnetosphere–ionosphere coupling during High-Intensity Long-Duration Continuous AE Activity (HILDCAA) intervals driven by HSSs reveals rapidly varying interplanetary magnetic field that produces high but intermittent dayside reconnection rates, resulting in large, quasi-periodic enhancements in the auroral electrojet index over several days. This persistent but fluctuating coupling represents a different regime than isolated flare events, consistent with the priming-window concept of transition from isolated amplification windows to sustained enhancement during multi-day HSS forcing (Tsurutani et al., 2018; Hajra et al., 2014).

## Evidence Gaps and Testable Predictions

While the component mechanisms (HSS–tropospheric coupling, conductivity persistence, gravity-wave–ionosphere coupling) have individual observational support, direct observational confirmation of the specific priming-window effect remains to be demonstrated. The core insight predicts:

1. **Conditional amplification**: Identical tropospheric gravity waves (matched energy flux, period, wavelength) arriving during versus outside conductivity-enhancement windows should produce factor-of-2 to factor-of-4 different F-region TEC perturbations. Current literature demonstrates HSS–precipitation correlation and separate gravity-wave–ionosphere coupling, but not the conditional amplification of one by recent occurrence of the other.

2. **Temporal window structure**: Enhanced coupling efficiency should persist 3–10 hours post-flare or HSS arrival, then decay exponentially with a 4–8 hour time constant. Current evidence shows multi-day effects for sustained HSS driving, but high-resolution temporal profiles of coupling efficiency following isolated events have not been reported.

3. **Dimensionless intensity metric**: The proposed coupling intensity Λ = (σ/σ₀) × (E_wave/E_thresh) should stratify observations into distinct regimes (sub-threshold <1, linear 1–3, amplified >3). Testing requires simultaneous measurements of ionospheric conductivity, gravity-wave energy flux, and resulting F-region perturbations across many events to build statistical distributions.

The supporting evidence establishes the physical plausibility of the priming-window framework by confirming that its constituent mechanisms operate on the required timescales and exhibit the necessary dependencies. Falsification or confirmation requires targeted observational campaigns (e.g., superposed-epoch analysis of SZIGO vertical electric-field records + GNSS TEC + GOES X-ray + WWLLN/GLD360 lightning) designed to test the specific conditional-amplification prediction.
