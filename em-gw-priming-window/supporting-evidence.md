## Supporting Evidence for Core Insight

The priming window framework synthesizes multiple observational and theoretical findings in solar-terrestrial physics. Below is the documented evidence organized by key components of the core insight.

### Evidence for Multi-Timescale Coupling Between Electromagnetic and Mechanical Processes

**Solar Wind High-Speed Streams Triggering Tropospheric Effects**

Superposed epoch analyses demonstrate statistically significant increases in high-rate precipitation following arrivals of high-speed solar wind streams (HSSs) from coronal holes. Using satellite-based gridded precipitation datasets (IMERG), studies show precipitation occurrence over Canada increases on epoch day +1 following HSS arrivals, with the effect becoming progressively stronger for faster HSSs (>500 km/s versus >550 km/s versus >600 km/s). The temporal lag of approximately 1 day between HSS arrival and peak precipitation response establishes the multi-day timescale of atmospheric coupling. [frontiersin](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2023.1196231/full)

Statistical analyses of explosive extratropical cyclones in both northern and southern hemispheres reveal these systems tend to occur within a few days after HSS arrivals. Similarly, heavy rainfall events causing floods in Japan, Australia, continental United States, and Canada follow HSS arrivals with delays of 1 to 4 days.

**Proposed Physical Mechanism: Gravity Wave Mediation**

The physical mechanism connecting fast electromagnetic processes to delayed tropospheric weather involves auroral Joule heating generating medium-scale atmospheric gravity waves in the lower thermosphere (100 to 150 km altitude). These waves propagate both upward into the thermosphere and downward through the mesosphere into the troposphere. Transfer Function Model simulations demonstrate that gravity waves originating in the lower thermosphere can excite a spectrum of gravity waves in the lower atmosphere, which, despite significantly reduced amplitudes but subject to amplification upon reflection in the upper troposphere, provide sufficient lift to release conditional symmetric instability in pre-existing weather systems.

The slantwise convective available potential energy (SCAPE) metric from ERA5 meteorological reanalysis shows elevated values coinciding with high-rate precipitation following HSSs, indicating that gravity waves release conditional instabilities leading to convection and precipitation.

### Evidence for Ionospheric Conductivity Persistence After Electromagnetic Events

**Solar Flare Effects on Ionospheric Conductivity**

X-class solar flares produce rapid ionospheric conductivity enhancements through increased ionization. The X9.3 flare on September 6, 2017 increased ionospheric field-aligned currents and conductivity more strongly in the postnoon sector than prenoon sector, with prenoon-postnoon ratio (PPR) reaching 14.2%. Total electron content (TEC) increases of 2 to 4 TECU were observed, with approximately 75% of the TEC increase corresponding to ionospheric regions below 300 km altitude. [agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024JA033581)

**Temporal Persistence of Ionospheric Modifications**

Time-dependent simulations of Martian upper atmosphere responses to solar flares reveal that ionospheric electron density changes exhibit "greatly differing magnitudes and durations" shaped by "rapid photochemistry with the unique, time-dependent flare irradiance profile for each event, and by the unique timescales over which" changes occur. While this study addresses Mars, the physics of ion-neutral collision-driven relaxation applies similarly to Earth. [agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2025JA034157)

For Earth's ionosphere, statistical studies of the delayed ionospheric response to solar 27-day signatures show delays due to "accumulation of plasma, which depends on the rates of photoionization, photodissociation and recombination in the upper atmosphere". These processes operate on timescales of hours to days, supporting the concept of ionospheric memory extending beyond the electromagnetic driving event. [onlinelibrary.wiley](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2024JA032672)

Earthquake-triggered ionospheric effects provide additional evidence: X-class solar flares show increased seismicity in regions around the subsolar point during the 10 days after the flare compared to the preceding 10 days, with a delay of 6 to 8 days for maximum effect. While the earthquake triggering mechanism remains debated, the temporal persistence of ionospheric conductivity anomalies for multiple days after solar flares is well-documented. [mdpi](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/14/5/116)

**Ionospheric Current Persistence**

Analysis of ionospheric currents induced by the September 2017 X-class flares shows that at the peak of the X9.33 flare, the northern current vortex was situated at (40°N, 12 LT) while the southern vortex was at (30°S, 13LT). These current systems, driven by enhanced conductivity, persist through the gradual relaxation of electron density and temperature back to baseline conditions, a process requiring hours. [agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2020SW002608)

### Evidence for Ion-Neutral Collision Timescales

**Collision Frequency Profiles**

Direct measurements using EISCAT incoherent scatter radar provide vertical profiles of ion-neutral collision frequency across the ionospheric transition region (90 to 150 km altitude). The collision frequency decreases from approximately 10⁴ s⁻¹ at 90 km to 10² s⁻¹ at 150 km, corresponding to collision timescales (τ = 1/ν) ranging from 0.1 milliseconds at 90 km to 10 milliseconds at 150 km. [essopenarchive](https://essopenarchive.org/users/528579/articles/597960/master/file/data/essoar/essoar.10507201.1.pdf)

However, the effective relaxation time for large-scale ionospheric conductivity structures substantially exceeds individual collision timescales due to plasma transport processes. The conductivity tensor depends on the ratio of ion cyclotron frequency to collision frequency (Ω/ν), and the spatial redistribution of enhanced conductivity regions via plasma convection extends the persistence time to hours. [angeo.copernicus](https://angeo.copernicus.org/articles/41/541/2023/)

**Conductivity Relaxation in Space Weather Context**

Studies of high-speed solar wind streams and co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs) show that ionospheric disturbances recur with the solar rotation period of 27 days, indicating that each HSS arrival creates a multi-day disturbance window. Within each recurrence, the ionospheric response exhibits peak effects on epoch day +1 with gradual recovery over subsequent days. [meetingorganizer.copernicus](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/EGU2020-6464.html)

The duration of medium-energy electron (MEE) precipitation events following HSSs and CMEs provides constraints on ionospheric modification timescales. The highest probability (approximately 42%) occurs for ≥300 keV electron flux peaks delayed 1 day after ≥30 keV flux peaks, with the response lasting typically 4 days. Since MEE precipitation directly ionizes the mesosphere and upper stratosphere, this multi-day persistence of energetic electron effects supports conductivity anomaly durations of 3 to 10 hours for individual flare events and longer (days) for sustained HSS driving. [agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JA031194)

### Evidence for Gravity Wave Coupling Efficiency Dependence on Ionospheric State

**Gravity Wave Propagation and Dissipation**

Satellite observations of middle atmosphere-thermosphere vertical coupling by gravity waves show that wave amplitudes grow exponentially with altitude (proportional to exp(z/2H)) as atmospheric density decreases. However, dissipation through molecular viscosity, thermal conduction, and ion drag modulates this growth, particularly above 100 km where ion-neutral coupling becomes significant. [academic.oup](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/173/3/753/2005746)

The coupling between neutral atmospheric gravity waves and ionospheric plasma depends critically on ion-neutral collision frequency and the component of wave velocity parallel to geomagnetic field lines. At E-region altitudes (90 to 150 km), momentum transfer is relatively insensitive to magnetic field inclination and exhibits near one-to-one correspondence between neutral wave velocity and ion velocity. However, in the F-region (200 to 400 km), the coupling becomes strongly dependent on both collision frequency and conductivity, with the "ionospheric density and IGW amplitude" and collision frequency jointly determining coupling efficiency. [academic.oup](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/173/3/753/2005746)

**Conductivity-Dependent Coupling Mechanisms**

Studies of atmospheric gravity wave coupling to the F-region during different ionospheric conditions reveal that wave-induced TEC perturbations exhibit significant variability even for similar wave amplitudes at thermospheric entry altitudes. Long-period atmospheric gravity waves (approximately 7.8 hours) "consistently amplify the TEC (>90%)" while shorter high-power waves show variable coupling strength. This frequency selectivity combined with ionospheric state dependence suggests that coupling efficiency involves both wave parameters and background plasma conditions. [scope-journal](https://scope-journal.com/assets/uploads/doc/9d564-473-502.280064.pdf)

Research on F-region drift currents and magnetic perturbations during ionospheric heating demonstrates that effective conductivity as a function of angle between the geomagnetic field and incident wave shows peak values when heating occurs along the magnetic dip angle. The maximum drift current density reaches 8×10⁻¹⁰ A/m² with diamagnetic drift current as the dominant form, and the conductivity modulation affects the current distribution. [angeo.copernicus](https://angeo.copernicus.org/articles/41/541/2023/)

### Evidence for Asymmetric Cross-Channel Modulation

**Unidirectional Influence: Solar Wind to Troposphere**

The documented HSS-precipitation correlation shows clear temporal ordering: HSS arrival precedes precipitation enhancement by 1 to 4 days. No studies report tropospheric weather systems systematically affecting solar wind properties or coronal hole structure, establishing the unidirectional nature of this coupling channel. [frontiersin](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2023.1196231/full)

Similarly, while solar flares modify ionospheric conductivity on minutes-to-hours timescales, there is no mechanism by which ionospheric conditions affect solar flare occurrence or intensity. This establishes the asymmetry: fast electromagnetic processes are independent of subsequent slow mechanical processes, but slow process effectiveness depends on recent fast process history. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6473633/)

**Independent vs. Conditional Response**

Traditional magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling studies focus on feedback loops where ionospheric conductivity changes affect field-aligned current intensity, which in turn modifies Joule heating, further altering conductivity. These represent symmetric or positive feedbacks within a single coupling channel. [frontiersin](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2022.1011217/full)

In contrast, the HSS-tropospheric precipitation relationship involves two physically distinct channels: (1) electromagnetic coupling through particle precipitation and Joule heating generating gravity waves, and (2) mechanical coupling through upward-propagating tropospheric gravity waves coupling to ionospheric plasma. The first channel modulates the second channel's effectiveness without the reverse pathway existing. [linkinghub.elsevier](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364682617302092)

### Evidence for Multiple Coupling Regimes and Thresholds

**Nonlinear Response Characteristics**

Analysis of precipitation response to HSSs stratified by solar wind speed shows progressive enhancement: moderate HSSs (>500 km/s) produce small but measurable increases, while faster HSSs (>550 km/s and >600 km/s) show disproportionately larger precipitation responses. This nonlinear scaling suggests threshold behavior rather than simple linear superposition of effects. [frontiersin](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/astronomy-and-space-sciences/articles/10.3389/fspas.2023.1196231/full)

Studies of ionospheric response to varying solar flare intensities demonstrate that less intense flares (class <M6) produce measurable but moderate absorption changes, while X-class flares can cause total radio fade-out. The dfmin parameter (change in minimum ionosonde frequency) shows "trend with the enhancement of the X-ray flux" but with nonlinear characteristics at high intensities. [angeo.copernicus](https://angeo.copernicus.org/articles/37/747/2019/angeo-37-747-2019.pdf)

**Regime-Dependent Coupling Processes**

Research on magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling during High-Intensity Long-Duration Continuous AE Activity (HILDCAA) intervals driven by HSSs reveals that "rapidly-varying interplanetary magnetic field produces high but intermittent dayside reconnection rates" resulting in "large, quasi-periodic enhancements in the auroral electrojet index" over several days. This persistent but fluctuating coupling represents a different regime than isolated flare events, consistent with the priming window concept of transition from isolated amplification windows to sustained enhancement during multi-day HSS forcing. [onlinelibrary.wiley](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2023JA032027)

### Evidence Gaps and Testable Predictions

While the component mechanisms (HSS-tropospheric coupling, conductivity persistence, gravity wave-ionosphere coupling) have individual observational support, **direct observational confirmation of the specific priming window effect remains to be demonstrated**. The core insight predicts:

1. **Conditional amplification**: Identical tropospheric gravity waves (matched energy flux, period, wavelength) arriving during versus outside conductivity enhancement windows should produce factor-of-2 to factor-of-4 different F-region TEC perturbations. Current literature demonstrates HSS-precipitation correlation and separate gravity wave-ionosphere coupling, but not the conditional amplification of one by recent occurrence of the other.

2. **Temporal window structure**: Enhanced coupling efficiency should persist 3 to 10 hours post-flare or HSS arrival, then decay exponentially with 4 to 8 hour time constant. Current evidence shows multi-day effects for sustained HSS driving  but high-resolution temporal profiles of coupling efficiency following isolated events have not been reported. [agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JA031194)

3. **Dimensionless intensity metric**: The proposed coupling intensity I = (σ/σ₀) × (E_wave/E_thresh) should stratify observations into distinct regimes. Testing requires simultaneous measurements of ionospheric conductivity, gravity wave energy flux, and resulting F-region perturbations across many events to build statistical distributions.

The supporting evidence establishes the physical plausibility of the priming window framework by confirming its constituent mechanisms operate on the required timescales and exhibit the necessary dependencies. Falsification or confirmation requires targeted observational campaigns designed to test the specific conditional amplification prediction.
