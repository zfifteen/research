Hypothesis (revised):
===
If any Casimir-based propulsion concept is real, the most plausible engineering path is not a single large static gap, but a dense array of nanoscale “cells” that are actively modulated, because the performance limit will be set by how much non-equilibrium asymmetry you can impose per unit area per unit time without overheating, not by the peak static Casimir force.

Most writeups treat “Casimir propulsion” as a geometry/material optimization problem: build one best sandwich, hold it fixed, and expect a usable thrust. That framing hides the dominant bottleneck: whatever mechanism creates the required asymmetry (biasing, carrier injection, temperature gradients, optical pumping, etc.) has an energy cost per cycle and a heat-rejection constraint. The question is therefore: impulse delivered per cycle vs energy spent per cycle, under a cooling limit.

At large scales with micron-class gaps, two things typically work against you:
1) The actuation/maintenance energy tends to scale with the physical mass/volume of what you are driving (electrodes, substrates, thermal reservoirs, supports), and
2) Heat removal is bottlenecked by conduction paths and packaging, so average power density is capped before you reach useful modulation depth or frequency.

At nanoscale dimensions (order 10–100 nm), the device can be built as many small, thermally short-path cells. This does not magically create net thrust, but it can change the attainable operating point: you can potentially modulate boundary conditions faster and/or with less stored energy per unit active area, while staying under the same allowable power density. In that regime, “arraying” matters because force-like terms sum with active area, while the per-cell energy overhead can fall with miniaturization if the relevant thermal and electrical path lengths shrink.

Pulsing is not claimed to multiply thrust for free. Instead, pulsing is a way to trade peak asymmetry for duty cycle under a fixed average power ceiling. If the per-cycle impulse scales more strongly with reduced gap than the per-cycle energy cost does, then the thrust-to-power ratio should improve as the cell size and gap shrink, up to a hard limit set by parasitics (patch potentials, stiction/pull-in, roughness, tunneling, finite conductivity, dielectric loss, and switching losses).

Falsifiable prediction (what would make this useful or kill it):
For two devices with the same total active area and measured thermal power density, (A) a distributed nano-cell array with sub-100 nm gaps and (B) a single macro-gap device, the nano-array should achieve a significantly higher impulse-per-joule (or force-per-watt) only if it can demonstrate a larger modulation depth of the relevant boundary condition at the same or lower energy-per-cycle per unit area. If the measured impulse-per-joule does not improve (even modestly) as gap/cell size shrink—after controlling for electrostatic artifacts—then the “miniaturization path” claim is wrong.

This hypothesis does not assume that Casimir propulsion is already proven. It only claims: if there is any real, extractable impulse associated with modulating Casimir-like boundary conditions, then the scaling and thermal constraints make a pulsed nanoscale array the most testable and most scalable configuration to investigate, and static macroscale gaps are the least likely to show favorable thrust-to-power performance.
